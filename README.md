# Pac-Man Game with OpenGL and GLUT

This project is a simple Pac-Man game implemented using OpenGL and GLUT in C++. The game features basic movement, collision detection, and a simple user interface to start and reset the game.

## Features

- **Real-Time Pac-Man Movement:** Control Pac-Man with keyboard inputs.
- **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions with walls and obstacles.
- **Collectibles:** Diamonds that Pac-Man can collect.
- **Game Over Condition:** Ends the game when Pac-Man collides with certain obstacles.
- **Dynamic Blades:** Rotating blades add difficulty to the game.
- **User Interface:** Simple menu to start, stop, and exit the game.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pacman-game.git
cd pacman-game
```

2. **Install OpenGL and GLUT:**
   - Ensure you have OpenGL and GLUT installed on your system. On Ubuntu, you can install them using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
```

## Usage

1. **Compile the code:**

```bash
g++ -o pacman pacman.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
```

2. **Run the game:**

```bash
./pacman
```

3. **Instructions:**
   - Use `a` to move left.
   - Use `d` to move right.
   - Use `w` to move up.
   - Use `s` to move down.
   - Press `p` to start the game.
   - Press `r` to reset the game.
   - Press `space` to pause the game.
   - Press `q` to quit the game.

## Code Explanation

### Main Components

1. **Initialization:**
   - The `doInit` function sets up the initial OpenGL environment, including the background color, viewport, projection matrix, and lighting.

2. **Display Functions:**
   - `doDisplay`: Displays the welcome screen.
   - `pacMan`: Handles the main game loop, including Pac-Man movement, collision detection, and rendering the game objects.
   - `gameOver`: Displays the game over screen.

3. **Movement and Collision:**
   - The `s` function handles Pac-Man's movement and checks for collisions with walls, blades, and collectibles.
   - Keyboard input functions (`mykey`) to control Pac-Man's movement and handle game state changes.

4. **Rendering:**
   - Functions like `drawPacMan`, `wall`, and `blade` render the respective game objects.

5. **Menu:**
   - A simple GLUT menu to start, stop, and exit the game.
